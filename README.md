# spl-net implementing (the server)

for the client please check Client repository 

General Description
Please read the WHOLE assignment description before start implementing.

We all know how bad the university’s “Course Registration System” is, now you may have a chance to change it :-)

In this assignment you will implement a “Course Registration System” server and client. The communication between the server and the client(s) will be performed using a binary communication protocol.

 

The implementation of the server is based on the Thread-Per-Client (TPC) and Reactor servers taught in class.

 

You are required to implement the BGRS (Ben Gurion Registration System) protocol, which emulates a simple course registration system.

The messages in this protocol are binary numbers, composed of an opcode (short number of two bytes) which indicates the command, and the data needed for this command (in various lengths).

In the following sections, we define the specifications of the commands supported by the BGRS protocol.

 

Unlike real course registration systems, the courses are specified in one file, according to a specific format (shown below). The data which the server and clients get during their running are saved in the RAM (in data structures, e.g., arrays, lists, etc…)


Establishing a client/server connection
Upon connecting, a client must identify himself to the service. A new client will issue a Register command with the requested user name and password. A registered client can then login using the Login command. Once the command is sent, the server will acknowledge the validity of the username and password. Once a user is logged in successfully, she can submit other commands. The register and login commands are stated in the following section. Note that the register command will not perform automatic login (you will need to call login after it).

1.2 Courses File

The data about the courses (for the server use) are given by a text file which you will define beforehand. The file name MUST be Courses.txt, and it should be located in the main folder (the project folder). The file consists of lines, where every line refers to a specific course. The format of a single line will be as follows:

courseNum|courseName|KdamCoursesList|numOfMaxStudents

courseNum: the number of the course (100>= int >= 0)

courseName: the course name (non-empty string)

KdamCoursesList: the list of the Kdam courses. (format: [course1Num, course2Num,...])

numOfMaxStudents: the maximum number of students allowed to register to this course(int >= 5)

No spaces before and after the ‘|’ character - you don’t need to check that.

The course name doesn’t contain the ‘|’ character - you also don’t need to check that.

You can assume that the courses file is formatted well (means, all courses lines are written in the correct format), so no need to check that.

Example:

42|How to Train Your Dragon|[43,2,32,39]|25









1.3 Supported Commands
The BGRS protocol is composed of two types of commands, Server-to-Client and Client-to-Server. The commands begin with 2 bytes (short) to describe the opcode . The rest of the message will be defined specifically for each command as such:




2 bytes

Length defined by command

Opcode

…


We supplied functions that encode \ decode between 2 bytes and short for both java and C++ in the assignment page.


The BGRS protocol supports 11 types of messages:

1)Client-to-Server messages
2)Server-to-Client messages

ACK Messages are used to acknowledge different Messages. Each ACK contains the message number for which the ack was sent. In the optional section there will be additional data for some of the Messages (if a message uses the optional section it will be specified under the message description).

All Messages that appear in a Client-to-Server communication require an ack/error message in response.

Parameters:
Opcode: 12.
Message Opcode: The message opcode the ACK was sent for.
Optional: changes for each message.


Client screen output:
Any ACK message received in client should be written to the screen in the following manner:
ACK <Message Opcode>
<Optional>
Printing of the optional part: split between optional parameters by space.
ERROR Messages:

Messages have the following format:


2 bytes

2 bytes

Opcode

Message Opcode


Messages that appear only in a Server-to-Client communication.

An ERROR message may be the acknowledgment of any other type of message. In case of error, an error message should be sent.

Parameters:
Opcode: 13.
Message Opcode: The message opcode the ERROR was sent for.


Error Notification:
Any error message received in client should be written to screen:
ERROR <Message Opcode>


In any case, if the message cannot be processed successfully, or the user is not allowed to send this message (e.g. student sends an admin message), the server returns an ERROR message.

Implementation Details
General Guidelines
The server should be written in Java. The client should be written in C++ with BOOST. Both should be tested on Linux installed at CS computer labs or the provided VM.

You must use maven as your build tool for the server and MakeFile for the c++ client.

The same coding standards expected in the course and previous assignments are expected here.

Server
You will have to implement a single protocol, supporting both the Thread-Per-Client and Reactor server patterns presented in class. Code seen in class for both servers is included in the assignment wiki page. You are also provided with a new class:


Database – This is a singleton class that should be used in order to manage the Courses and Users. You must only use this class in order to do that. Notice that this class should be thread-safe.
boolean initialize(String coursesFilePath) – loades the courses from the file path specified into the Database, returns true if successful.
public static Database getInstance() – Retrieves the single instance of this class.
(example - not required) String getUserPassword(String UserName) – returns the password of the username
        



Left to you, are the following tasks:


Finish the Database class.
Implement the MessagingProtocol and MessageEncoderDecoder to support the BGRS protocol as described in section 1.2.  The implementations MUST not be specific for the protocol implementation. You will also need to define messages(<T> in the interfaces). You may add more classes as necessary to implement the protocol (shared protocol data ect…).

Leading questions:
Which classes and interfaces are part of the Server pattern and which are part of the Protocol implementation?
When and how do I register a new user in the Database class.
Which class(es) use the Database class, apart from the initialize?
When do I call initialize to initiate the Database?
Tip:

You can test tasks 1 by fixing one of the examples in the impl folder in the supplied spl-net.zip to work with your implementations (easiest is the echo example)


Testing run commands:
Reactor server:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=”bgu.spl.net.impl.BGRSServer.ReactorMain” -
Dexec.args=”<port> <No of threads>”

Thread per client server:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=”bgu.spl.net.impl.BGRSServer.TPCMain” -
Dexec.args=”<port>”

The server directory should contain a pom.xml file and the src directory. Compilation will be done from the server folder using:

mvn compile

Client
An echo client is provided, but its a single threaded client. While it is blocking on stdin (read from keyboard) it does not read messages from the socket. You should improve the client so that it will run 2 threads. One should read from the keyboard while the other should read from socket. The client should receive the server’s IP and PORT as arguments. You may assume a network disconnection does not happen (like disconnecting the network cable). You may also assume legal input via keyboard.


The client should receive commands using the standard input. Commands are defined in section 1.2 under command initiation sub sections. You will need to translate from keyboard command to network messages and the other way around to fit the specifications.


Notice that the client should close itself upon reception of an ACK message in response to an outgoing LOGOUT command.


The Client directory should contain a src, include and bin subdirectories and a Makefile as shown in class. The output executable for the client is named BGRSclient and should reside in the bin folder after calling make.


Testing run commands: BGRSclient <ip> <port>


Submission instruction
Submission is done only in pairs. If you do not have a pair, find one. You need explicit authorization from the course staff to submit without a pair. You cannot submit in a group larger than two.
You must submit one .tar.gz file with all your code. The file should be named "ID#1_ID#2.tar.gz". Note: We require you to use a .tar.gz file. Files such as .rar,
.zip, .bz, or anything else which is not a .tar.gz file will not be accepted and your grade will suffer.

Extension requests are to be sent to Dolav. Your request email must include the following information:
Your name and your partners name.
Your id and your partners id.
Explanation regarding the reason of the extension request.
Official certification for your illness or army drafting. Requests without a compelling reason will not be accepted
The submitted file should contain a Client directory and a Server directory (Their content was explained in the implementation section).
Examples
The following section contains examples of commands running on clients. It assumes that the software opened a socket properly and a connection has been initiated.

We use “CLIENT#No<” and “CLIENT#No>” to annotate client #No terminal input (keyboard) \ output (screen print). The order of commands matches the order of reception on the server. Server and client actions are explained in between.

Note that the examples do not show the actual structure of the network messages, just the input \ output on the client terminal. The translation should be done according to specifications in section 1.2.


Registration and login
Server assumptions for example:

Server currently has 1 registered user named “Morty” with password “a123”
Kdam and Unregistering from courses
Server assumptions for example:

No users are registered (via STUDENTREG).

Keyboard command to packet
In this section we will show a few keyboard commands and their matching network messages. Note that since network messages are just an array of bytes, we will print the hex values of those byte array.

Reminder: A byte can be represented by 2 hexadecimal values (0 to f), each representing 4 bits of the 8 in a single byte.
